# Bahai Life Coach Agent - Summary

## Overview

The Bahai Life Coach Agent is a conversational AI assistant that provides life coaching based on Bahai principles and teachings. It offers personalized guidance, reflection prompts, and spiritual insights to help users navigate life's challenges.

## Implementation Details

The agent is implemented using:
- LangChain for orchestrating the conversation flow
- Flask for the web interface
- Ollama for local LLM integration
- Browser's Speech API for voice interaction

## Running Options

You have three ways to run the Bahai Life Coach Agent:

1. **Main Web Server** (Standard approach):
   ```bash
   python app/web_server.py
   ```
   This uses the full LangChain implementation with all features.

2. **Simplified Web Server** (Recommended for Ollama):
   ```bash
   python simple_web_server.py
   ```
   This provides a more direct integration with Ollama, avoiding compatibility issues.

3. **Console Interface** (For command-line usage):
   ```bash
   python app/main.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Compatibility Problems**:
   - Use the simplified web server (`simple_web_server.py`)
   - Ensure Ollama is running (`curl http://localhost:11434/api/version`)
   - Check that you have the llama3.2 model installed (`curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags`)

2. **Voice Mode Issues**:
   - Access via localhost or HTTPS
   - Grant microphone permissions in your browser
   - Use a modern browser (Chrome, Edge)

3. **Testing Ollama Directly**:
   - Run `python test_ollama_direct.py` to verify Ollama is working
   - Run `python simple_test.py` to test the LangChain integration

## Next Steps for Development

To enhance the agent:

1. **Improve Prompts**:
   - Update the system prompt in `app/prompts/life_coach_prompts.py`
   - Add more specific guidance for different life situations

2. **Add Features**:
   - Implement goal tracking
   - Add more reflection templates
   - Create a journaling feature

3. **Enhance UI**:
   - Improve the chat interface
   - Add visualization for insights
   - Create a mobile-friendly design

## Conclusion

The Bahai Life Coach Agent provides a foundation for spiritual guidance and personal development based on Bahai principles. The simplified web server ensures compatibility with Ollama, making it accessible without requiring an OpenAI API key.
