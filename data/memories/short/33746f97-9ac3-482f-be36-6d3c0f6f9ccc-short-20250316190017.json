  "content": "Ismael, feeling tired and spiritually unanchored amidst positive life changes, sought guidance. He described a desire for a structured, contemplative life aligned with his Bah\u00e1'\u00ed faith. The assistant focused on manageable steps, suggesting a shift from obligation to gentle permission in his morning spiritual practice due to his ADHD and Pathological Demand Avoidance. He was encouraged to place his prayer book on his pillow and the conversation ended with a prayer and quote to motivate him.",
