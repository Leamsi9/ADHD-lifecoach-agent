  "summary": "The session began with an invitation to Bah\u00e1'\u00ed prayer for a positive atmosphere. The coach proposed evaluating the user's current state across five domains: physical, emotional, professional, familial, and spiritual, using a 1-5 rating scale. This holistic approach aimed to identify areas needing attention. While no specific issues were discussed yet, the focus was on assessing overall well-being and establishing a framework for future coaching based on Bah\u00e1'\u00ed principles of spiritual growth and balanced development. The user's initial ratings would inform the subsequent discussion and action planning.",
