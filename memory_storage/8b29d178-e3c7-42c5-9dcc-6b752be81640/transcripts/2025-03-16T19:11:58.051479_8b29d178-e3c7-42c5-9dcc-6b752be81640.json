Would you like to begin with a Bah\u00e1'\u00ed prayer to set a positive tone for our session?\n\nAlso, to get started, could you give me a quick rating (1-5, where 1 is \"crisis\" and 5 is \"great\") for how you're feeling in these areas today: physically, emotionally, professionally, in your family life, and spiritually?"
